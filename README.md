# Task 1
Compare three sorting algorithms: merge sort, insertion sort, and Timsort in terms of execution time.
The analysis should be supported by empirical data, obtained by testing the algorithms on various datasets. Empirically verify the theoretical complexity estimates of the algorithms, for example, by sorting large arrays. Use the timeit module to measure the execution time of the algorithms.

# Task 2
You are given k sorted lists of integers. Your task is to merge them into one sorted list. While completing this task, you may refer to the merge sort algorithm from the lecture notes.

Implement a function called merge_k_lists which takes a list of sorted lists as input and returns a single sorted list.
